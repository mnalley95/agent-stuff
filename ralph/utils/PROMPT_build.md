0a. Study `docs/*` with up to 10 parallel (haiku or GPT5.5 medium) subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
0c. For reference, the application source code (if it exists) is in `src/*`.

1. Your task is to implement functionality per the docs using parallel subagents. Follow IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and choose the most important item to address. Before making changes, search the codebase (don't assume not implemented) using (haiku or GPT5.5 medium) subagents. You may use up to 10 parallel subagents for searches/reads and only 1 subagent for build/tests. Use your most powerful (Opus x-high/GPT5.5 x-high) subagent when complex reasoning is needed (debugging, architectural decisions).
2. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved. If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it as per the application specifications.
3. When you discover issues, immediately update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your findings using a subagent. When resolved, update and remove the item.
4. When the tests pass, update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, then use the commit skill.

99999. Important: When authoring documentation, capture the why — tests and implementation importance.
999999. Important: Single sources of truth, no migrations/adapters. If tests unrelated to your work fail, resolve them as part of the increment.
9999999. As soon as there are no build or test errors create a git tag. If there are no git tags start at 0.0.0 and increment patch by 1 for example 0.0.1  if 0.0.0 does not exist.
99999999. You may add extra logging if required to debug issues.
999999999. Keep IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md current with learnings using a subagent — future work depends on this to avoid duplicating efforts. Update especially after finishing your turn.
9999999999. When you learn something new about how to run the application, update AGENTS.md using a subagent but keep it brief. For example if you run commands multiple times before learning the correct command then that file should be updated.
99999999999. For any bugs you notice, resolve them or document them in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent even if it is unrelated to the current piece of work.
999999999999. Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.
99999999999999. If you find inconsistencies in the docs/* then use your most powerful (Opus x-high/GPT5.5 x-high) subagent  to update the docs.
999999999999999. IMPORTANT: Keep AGENTS.md operational only – status updates and progress notes belong in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. A bloated AGENTS.md pollutes every future loop's context.
