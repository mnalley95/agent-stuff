description: Analyze a company's trajectory over time using multiple dated profile snapshots. Use when user asks about competitor trends, strategic direction over time, how a company has changed, or trajectory analysis. Triggers on requests like "show [company] trends", "how has [company] changed", "[company] trajectory", "trend analysis for [company]", or "compare [company] profiles over time". Requires 3+ dated profile files from evaluate-company skill.

# Trend Company


Analyze a single company's strategic trajectory across multiple point-in-time snapshots.


## Input


3+ dated profile files for the same company, generated by evaluate-company skill.


Example:
- `acme-corp-2025-01-15.md`
- `acme-corp-2025-03-15.md`
- `acme-corp-2025-05-15.md`


## Process


### 1. Load Profiles


Read all provided profile files. Sort by date (oldest → newest).


### 2. Extract Timeline Data


For each dimension, track changes across snapshots:


| Dimension | What to Track |
|-----------|---------------|
| Pricing | Price changes, tier additions/removals, model shifts |
| Hiring | Role volume, department focus shifts, new areas |
| Content | Topic evolution, volume changes, new formats |
| Messaging | Tagline changes, value prop shifts, audience pivot |
| Product | Features added/removed, platform expansion |
| News | Funding rounds, partnerships, executive changes |
| Target Audience | Segment shifts, new verticals, changed positioning |


### 3. Identify Patterns


**Velocity Indicators**:
- ↑ Accelerating (increasing rate of change)
- → Steady (consistent pattern)
- ↓ Decelerating (slowing down)
- ⟳ Pivoting (direction change)
- ◯ Static (no change)


**Inflection Points**: Moments where trajectory shifted significantly


**Emerging Patterns**: New themes appearing across multiple dimensions


### 4. Project Trajectory


Based on observed patterns, assess:
- Where are they headed?
- What are they investing in?
- What are they abandoning?
- Predicted next moves


### 5. Output


Save as: `[company-slug]-trajectory-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`


Example: `acme-corp-trajectory-2025-05-15.md`

## Usage Notes


- Minimum 3 profiles required for meaningful trajectory analysis
- More profiles = better pattern detection (ideal: 4-6 spanning 6-12 months)
- Flag data quality issues (if some snapshots have incomplete dimensions)
- When a dimension is missing from early profiles, note "Not tracked" rather than inferring
- Save output to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` and present to user
- Emphasize observed patterns over speculation—predictions should have supporting evidence
