# Interrogate Company

Enable interactive Q&A grounded in a competitor profile, framed around your company's specific situation.

## Setup

### 1. Load the company profile

If the user specifies a profile file, read it. Otherwise, auto-detect the most recent profile in the current directory:

```bash
ls -t *-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9].md 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If multiple profiles are found, ask the user which to load. Read the full profile before proceeding.

### 2. Load your company context

Check for `my-company.md` in this order:
1. `./my-company.md` (current directory)
2. `~/.claude/my-company.md` (global config)

If found, read it silently and use it to frame all answers.

If not found, ask:

> "Before we start — give me a 2–3 sentence description of your company or product so I can frame answers around your specific situation. (Type 'skip' for generic analysis.)"

### 3. Confirm and open the session

Acknowledge what was loaded in one line:

> "Loaded: **[Company Name]** profile ([date]). [Your company: X.] Ready — ask anything, or pick a starter:"

Then present the starter questions from `references/question-prompts.md`, grouped by category.

## Answering Questions

### Ground answers in the profile

Cite specific evidence from the profile in every answer. Reference sections explicitly:
- "Their pricing page shows three tiers starting at..."
- "Per their LinkedIn posts, they're pushing [theme] heavily..."
- "The sitemap reveals a dedicated `/enterprise` section that..."

Never invent facts not in the profile.

### Supplement with live research when needed

If the user asks about something the profile doesn't cover (a recent event, a specific product detail, a market trend, a new hire), say:

> "That's not in the profile — let me look it up."

Use WebSearch and WebFetch to find the answer. Incorporate findings into the response and note the source URL.

### Frame answers around your company

When company context is loaded, make answers specific and actionable:
- "Given that you [do X], their gap in [Y] is a direct opening..."
- "Your [feature/approach] speaks directly to what their customers complain about: [Z]"
- "At their pricing, you can undercut at [tier] while matching their core value prop"

Without company context, use generic competitive framing ("a competitor could...").

## Save Session to File

When the user ends the session (or asks to save), write the full Q&A to a markdown file:

```
[company-slug]-interrogation-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
```

Example: `acme-corp-interrogation-2026-02-24.md`

Format:
```markdown
# [Company Name] — Competitive Interrogation

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Profile used**: [filename]
**Your company**: [name or "not provided"]

---

## Q&A

**Q: [question]**

[answer]

---

**Q: [question]**

[answer]
```

Save to the same directory as the source profile. Mention the filename when done so the user can find it.

---

## Session Behavior

- Stay in analysis mode until the user explicitly ends the session
- After answering, offer a natural follow-up angle when one is obvious — don't pad every response
- Don't re-introduce yourself or re-confirm context after setup
- If the profile is older than 90 days, note it once: "This profile is from [date] — some details may be stale. Run evaluate-company to refresh."

---

## Guidelines

- Never fabricate product details, pricing, or customer names not present in the profile or found via live research
- When researching live, prefer the company's own site, LinkedIn, and official press releases over third-party summaries
- End answers with a concrete implication or next step where possible — avoid pure description
- For questions about the user's own strategy (not just the competitor), engage as a strategic thought partner, not just a data retriever
